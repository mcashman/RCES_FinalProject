## Last Interglacial sea level at Barbados: Can we constrain melt contributions from Greenland and Antarctica?

### Introduction/Intellectual Merit:
Reconstructions of global mean sea level (GMSL) for the Last Interglacial indicate that sea level may have been between 6 and 9 m higher than today. Better constraining sea level over the Last Interglacial will help constrain models of future sea level rise. A large contributer to the uncertainty in Last Interglacial sea level is that the melt contribution from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is unknown. 

### Project:
I used the Hibbert et al., 2016 fossil coral database for sea level reconstructions to test 12 likely melt scenarios for the Last Interglacial, each with different melt contributions from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Fossil coral reefs are commonly used as sea level indicators because corals grow close to the sea surface and can be dated by U/Th methods. I tested the 12 melt scenarios on two datasets: first, Barbados MIS 5 fossil coral data, and second, a subset of the Barbados MIS 5 dataset that looks only at corals thought to be pristine (higher confidence in the U/Th age). When testing the entire dataset against the 12 melt scenarios, 2 of the scenarios appear to not match the geologic evidence. However, the results of the second filtered dataset yield dramatically different results, indicating that all 12 of the melt scenarios agree with the geologic evidence. I explain the difference in results to a lack of pristine dates for Barbados. A more robust dataset of pristine coral dates would reduce the weight of outliers, while also maintaining high confidence in the age data.
